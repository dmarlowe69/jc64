This is JC64: a C64 Java Software Emulator

note: this program is under construction, actually no executable are released
to the public.

The JC64 is an emulator that try to 100% emulate a C64 (with the actual
knowledge about the various C64 chips) using the Java language. 
You must have a powerful system to run this program. Sorry, the real emulation
is the priority goal, unlike the speed emulation is the secondary goal.

The Java language is used due to his multiplatform and OOP characteristics.

The emulator is Threads based (multi-cpu system can take advantage of this).

The actual Vic code is very experimental: uses of dot clock for a 1 to 1
implementation of Vic II chip.

JC64dis  (beta release 1 of 2003):

Inside the program there is the JC64dis (beta release 1 of 2003) 
that disasseble PRG,SID and MUS file and produce a output file.

The class to run is:
  sw_emulator.software.FileDasm

JC64dis (Next generation C64 disassembler)

Inside the program there is the new JC64dis with a graphical
interface and an innovative 3 iterative panels to let you 
make a source code that can be understand by humans. 

The class to run is:
  sw_emulator.swing.main.JC64dis
