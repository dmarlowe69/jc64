/**
 * Implement a Monitor for sinchronizing threads
 * The available operation to the monitor are <code>opSignal</code> and
 * <code>opWait</code>. A internal counter is used for know when all the
 * given threads that use this monitor have finish to make their body.
 * This is needed as the caller of <code>opSignal</code> has to know
 * when the other has finish before going away. In the real system,
 * this is not needed as the operations terminate in the clock period 
 * of time. <code>opNotify</code> is to use for notify the thread that
 * call <code>opSignal</code> that this thread will do a <code>opWait</code>
 * in his body. Be carefull: if one thred use <code>opNotify</code> and will
 * not do an <code>opWait</code>, a deadlook will occurs.
